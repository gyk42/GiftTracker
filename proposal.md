# Project Plan
### What are your overall objectives for the project? What problem(s) are you solving? What user goals are you making possible?
* Goal is to make a gift tracker app so that people are aware of what they are receiving and what they are giving. Because we all have busy lives, it's hard to remember what a person received or what I gave out as gifts for various people.  I want to track it so that I don't repeat a gift or make sure I give out equivalent gift. 

### What is/are the main takeaways from your research findings? Briefly recap what you learned
* My ultimate goal for this app is to able for an user to just take a picture of what they received or give out and stored that information in the database so that an user doesn't have to type product information.  I realized that it's very hard to find a cocoapod that reads UPC code and finding an API that stores all the product information.

### Who is your target audience?
* Millennials who are conscious about their spendings on gifts.
* Millennials who are concerned that they don't give out cheaper gifts than they received from same person.

### What features will you include? They should map to your user goals. Make sure you offer a coherent rationale for why they were chosen.
* Database (Firebase) - Store user receive & give gift details
* Search ability - Make it easy for an user to search name of person and get the history of receiving and giving gift details

### How will this differentiate from your competitors? What pain points are being addressed?
* Competitors don't keep track of what gift a person receives. 
* Pain points might be that an user have to add the information one at a time by typing when they receive many gifts at once.  

### Are there any constraints you have to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
* My ultimate goal is to have the ability to find a way to get product information to add to the database.  I don't know if I have time to find an API that does exactly what I need.  So in the meantime, I might just have to settle for making the user take a photo of a product and store that photo in the database.

### Is there anything else you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what youâ€™re proposing?

### An answer to this question: Why was this an app instead of a website?
* This has to be an app because it makes it easier for an user to enter information about gifts they give and receive easily.
