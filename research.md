# Research Plan

**Title:** Gift tracker app field study  
**Author:** Grace Yu  
**Date:** 1/30/2017  
**Background:** I have a child who gets invited to lots of birthday parties. We spend decent amount of money to buy for my son's friend's birthday gifts.  But when my son had his birthday, we recieved many gifts that were way below what we got for particular child's birthday.  So, I started to track what we give out and what we recieved. Having this app will help me maintain a good history.   
**Goal:** To develop a great user experience   
**Resarch questions:**   
* How many gifts do you buy per year?  
* How many gifts did you receive this year?  
* Do you remember what you got for a person 3 years ago?  
* Do you keep track of what gifts you gave out?  
* Do you use any app to keep track of something?  
**Methodology:** Doing this research to find what the users want from this app.  
**Participants:** Target audience will be singles, couples and people who have children whom gets invited to various parties who are budget concious, who needs organization, who wants to keep track of gift received and give out.  
**Schedule:** TBD
